An IVOA Note to explore common patterns in the way that we use

To build a PDF version this document, you will need a reasonably
complete LaTeX installation, a sufficiently capable `make`, preferably
[latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/) and probably
[rsvg-convert](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg). For further
details, see [ivoatexDoc](https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATex/).
